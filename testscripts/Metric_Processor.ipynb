I am thrilled to be able to offer my students the same quality of learning they are used to at school in their homes. They were so excited when I pulled out the felt board and new felt pieces! In the one photo I showed you visual comparison of my homemade version of felt stories and the ones I got from you. What a difference! The students couldn&#039;t believe how colorful and detailed these &#034;real&#034; ones are. \\r\\n\\r\\nI used them in a couple of different ways. When I read &#034;The Panda Problem,&#034; I started out with a counting song: 10 Little Pandas. I often start with a version of that for my Kindergartners that correlates with the animal in the book.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I read &#034;The Hungry Caterpillar,&#034; we made a prediction of what would happen before the story was read. Some students had heard it before and told what they remembered. Then as we read it and put up the felt pieces we talked about whether we were right or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith &#034;Seven Blind Mice,&#034; we did a retelling. Such a variety of ways to use these pieces. My students and I LOVE them. Thank you so very much!!!

The books came quickly and I was able to review them again and source video recommendations from local teens to share with my students online. These video recommendations helped give my students entry points to the books, since the other teens helped bring them to life and give them more legitimacy as something they might enjoy. Then students reviewed the front and back covers of the books and compared the reading level of each book to their own to get a sense of its level of difficulty. You can see some of these assignments in the photos. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was lucky enough to also receive funding for a grant for school supplies for students doing distance learning at home, so I provided a book of each student's choice in the bag of school supplies. Each student got their first choice (of 3) books! Students and families have been so appreciative of these materials. As students have started reading their new books, I've gotten lots of feedback about how great it is for them to have a book they picked and I deeply appreciate you for having made that possible. For students reading a series, I even have the second book for them to start this summer if they get into it!

We did get to use the kits several times before our school was closed due to COVID-19. I have used Lego Education robotics kits for years, and they are a wonderful way to engage students in STEM learning. My class at Newton School did not have any robotics kits that students could build. The Lego robot kits allow students to build many different types of robots from plans or from their own design, which allows them to learn how to read diagrams, program a robot, and be creative! Having 3 robot kits adds to our class by providing materials for a Lego robot center for students to choose to work on robots independently. The Lego Wedo program is easy for the students to use independently so that they can follow the instructions to build and program the robot without much teacher direction. Hopefully we can get more robots to have a full class unit using the Lego Education curriculum.\\n\\nWith gratitude,\\nMrs. McKinney\",\n",

School distributes food to families on Mondays, so I went that day during the food distribution times and arranged for families to drive through the parking lot to pick up the bags of school supplies as well. Of my 24 students, 7 families came through the drive-through that day. I delivered three more to students' homes that day and the rest the following day. \\r\\n\\r\\nStudents and their families have appreciated the school supplies you donated. Many have reached out to me by text and email to thank me - and really they're thanking all of you who made this project possible. Students wrote about their feelings about these donations and you can see some of their writing in the photos. It means so much to our young people to be seen and supported during this difficult time. Thank you for helping me give them a bag of goodies they can use to continue learning. I have no doubt the materials will be well used and even shared with siblings as families try to finish this school year, learn at home this summer, and prepare for a new school year in the fall with even more limited resources.\\n\\nWith gratitude,\\nMrs. Klein\",\n",

Having a library in my room helps create conversations about the novels and encourages sharing what the students have liked and exploring new genres.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skills and lessons my students have begun with this new library includes BookSNAPS, mini-activities, and reviews. BookSNAPS uses online tools to share a photo of their active reading using annotation techniques learned in class. Students will notice a line or passage that is exceptionally well-written or depicts characterization/plot element development perfectly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this program funded by your generous donations, students read every week. They have set personal goals and are learning more about genres. They log their accomplishment and reflect on the style of writing they are learning they like. Since most students aren't familiar with all the genres, they remain with one style of writing. With this program, they get exposed to so many more genres and develop more appreciation.\\n\\nWith gratitude,\\nMrs. Merion\",\n",

Clay texture slabs are a great way for young artists to explore a variety of mark making in a manageable way. Our new slab roller has made this process so much easier! \\r\\nMy students were curious about the slab roller and they were eager to see how it worked. I demonstrated how to cut a thin piece of clay and how to put it through the slab roller. Students then took turns rolling the clay. I feel like this experience gave them more ownership of their piece of clay since they were able to participate in the process. Before the slab roller, I would have to hand roll each piece of clay because of time constraints. This was an arduous task for the amount of students I have! \\r\\nWe bagan making small sculptures to hang on the wall. Fourth graders read the book Owl Moon and created owls. Second graders were making texture hearts and 3rd grade was beginning texture fish. \\r\\nUnfortunately, their work is on hold due to Covid, but we are eager to complete the clay projects when school reopens.

They are gorgeous and tell stories of families who have overcome adversities. During our weekly ZOOM meetings, I have been reading the stories to them. Our favorite, by far, is Hair Love by Matthew A. Cherry. So cute! A Daddy is trying to help his daughter with her hair, but isn't sure what to do. He struggles to fix it, until it looks beautiful. \"Sometimes, love looks like braids, puffs, and twists.\" It describes a small, yet incredibly important, moment between a Father and a Daughter. A moment when a Father shows his Daughter the importance of never giving up. Most of all, it tells a story of a Father reminding his Daughter of what a beautiful soul she is. This story describes how we are ALL feeling right now, during the pandemic, trying to work on our own self love and self care.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What if you suddenly floated up, and found yourself flying, spinning, sailing over New York City?\" This is the story of Abuela by Arthur Dorros. This story took us on a Virtual Field Trip to New York City. The rich language includes Spanish phrases that the kids giggled at with wonder and amazement. Every story is beautiful and meaningful. I do believe in magic in this world. Thank you for helping my students escape from reality, yet find themselves at the same time.\\n\\nWith gratitude,\\nMrs. Joyce\",\n",

I am also able to learn from my students and understand what they feel and get a glimpse at the world through their eyes.

Prior to the school closure, the Chromebooks that you donated were used in small groups. Students used educational platforms such as IXL.com and Lexia Learning to continue to grow in their literacy skills. These educational platforms are very important because they pinpoint what skills students need to work on at an individual level. They also allow students to practice using technology - a skill that is very useful in today's society. Also, students were so excited that they had technology to work on their skills rather just pencil and paper worksheets. \\r\\n\\r\\nYour donation has also helped my students during the school closure. I let six students who do not have access to technology at their homes take the Chromebooks home. This allowed for them to fully engage in the distance learning. If you had not donated to my project, those six students would not have been able to complete their studies and actively engage in schoolwork at home. Distance learning has been challenging for all of my students, and access to technology has made it easier. I created a Google Classroom for students to not only continue their studies, but also engage with one another. The six students who received the donated Chromebooks are actively engaged in the Google Classroom and also love to connect with their peers and teachers. They also all participate in the live lessons every day of the week where they can have discussions about texts as if we were still all together. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, your donation has helped my students beyond what we could have expected. We all thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You have truly impacted the lives of my students.\\n\\nWith gratitude,\\nMs. Martinez\",\n",

With each funded project, I am overwhelmed by the support given to music education in our rural school in our rural county in our rural state. We did nothing to deserve your generous gifts but persevere, work hard, and try to live our best lives. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany of my students were inspired by guest musicians at our Appalachian Day festival. It is so delightful to see a young person's eyes light up. They really wanted a banjo but I think this banjolele will give them more immediate success after having practiced the ukulele and guitar. They regularly ask me if I have found a banjo for sale, cheap. I cannot wait to tell them that this project was funded. They are going to be so excited to hear it is on the way.\\n\\nWith gratitude,\\nMr. Russell\",\n",

The great news is the products arrived with plenty time for us to rehearse. The bad news is we have not had a chance to rehearse with them. We were sent home just before we would have started working on the stage for the primary program. The talent show, and 6th grade graduation performance never happened and that is when these materials would have had quite a workout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great news is these materials will be ready for use in the fall. We usually put on a really nice fall show with 5th and 6th graders. Picks are almost lost as much as pencils. Strings break and guitar cables wear out with use. In previous years, I was left scrambling around and borrowing cables from friends at the last minute when a cable would fail. Next year, we will be ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am most excited about the extra long speaker cable. A few years ago, we started the year with a new sound system and it has so far served our needs for numerous projects. The speaker cables that came with it put the amp in the center of the stage with the speakers on both sides. I have wanted to try putting the amp and iPad to the side and with this extra long cable, we will be able to do that.

They arrived a few days before our end-of-term party, and I wrapped them up so each student was able to open a gift. When they were placed under the tree, several kids eyeballed them and asked me in private if they were copies of Wonder. I shrugged and said maybe. \"Oh, I so hope so!\" One girl sighed to her friends. \"Yeah, me too!\" They wistfully agreed.\\r\\nWrapping 46 books is no joke, and to be honest it took me a few days. Each morning leading up to the last day, students would come in and check to see if their book had mysteriously \"arrived overnight\". Students from my first block would jump for joy when they saw their names, and when switching with second block, would update their friends on their gifts appearing as well. On the day of the party, I must have been asked ten thousand times if it was time to open their gifts yet! Finally, the end of the day rolled around and students were literally jumping for joy when they opened their books. \"I KNEW IT!!!!\" A few savvy friends yelled. \"I was so hoping this was Wonder, Ms. Klukow!\" \"It was the right size!!!\" Y'all, there were so many thank-yous and happy faces that day. \\r\\nI'm so very sorry we did not get our thank you cards out before Covid-19 closed our school. I had meant to get them to you right away but school chaos is never-ending and March brought that jarring closure. Hopefully I'll be able to send them in the fall, but if not, please know that there are 46 happy, happy children who have had a new book on their shelves while quarantined because of YOU, a beloved tale that brings hope as they were sadly separated from their friends and school-family. You brought that joy and hope to them, and I am so thankful and grateful for your kindness towards my favorite people. May God bless you for your kindness towards others! We're sending you all our love and digital thanks!!\\n\\nWith gratitude,\\nMs. Klukow\",\n",
