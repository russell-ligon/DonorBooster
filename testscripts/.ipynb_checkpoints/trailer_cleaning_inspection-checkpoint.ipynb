However, in real-life scenarios, text collections rarely come with metadata labels that tell you what the texts are about. When people answer open-ended survey questions, for example, they don't repeat detectable keywords in their answer with the topics they discuss."

    "**Topic modeling** is an unsupervised classification technique that is able to discover the topics in a collection of texts by looking at their commonalities. In this context, \"topics\" refers to groups of related words that often occur together in the same text. For example, in a collection of newspaper articles a topic model may identify one topic that is made up of words such as \"politician\", \"law\", and \"parliament\", and another characterized by words such as \"player\", \"match\" and \"penalty\". Topic models only go as far as identifying clusters of related words; a human is still needed to interpret these clusters and give them labels such as \"politics\" and \"football\". \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular topic models is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA is a generative model that sees every text as a mixture of topics and each sentence as a mixture of words. For example, the \"football\" topic will generate the word \"penalty\" with a high probability, while the \"politics\" topic will have a much higher probability for \"politician\" than for \"penalty\". Other words, such as \"the\" and \"an\", will have similar probabilities in all topics. LDA takes its name from the Dirichlet probability distribution. This is the prior distribution it assumes the topics in a text will have.\n",

    "Many collections of unstructured texts don't come with any labels. Topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation are a useful technique to discover the most prominent topics in such documents. Gensim makes training these topics model easy, and pyLDAvis presents the results in a visually attractive way. Together they form a powerful toolkit to better understand what's inside large sets of documents and to explore subsets of related texts. However, these methods can perform poorly in short texts with vague or unspecified subjects. Although traditional topic models are lacking in more semantic information (they don't use word embeddings, for instance), they can be really quick way of getting insights into large collections of documents."
